The goal of this practice is to introduce a new Vat for the products starting next month.
The new table is:
    "charity" : 5%,
    "bread": 10%

The problem is that the government want to check calling the "calculate" method that this is working before that
day in production.
So we have to give them a way to obtain that info without affecting users.

Rules:
- VatTest needs to run all the time
- We will work in small steps, each step needs to make pass all the tests. Each small step can be a commit.
- We will work in pairs, each one will fork this project.
- We will discuss again in 15 mins.
