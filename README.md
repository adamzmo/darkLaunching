The goal of this practice is to introduce a new Vat for the products starting next month.
The problem is that the goverment want to check calling the "calculate" method that this is working before that
day in production.
So we have to give them a way to obtain that info without affecting users

Rules:
- VatTest needs to run all the time
- We will work in small steps, each step needs to make pass all the tests. Each small step can be a commit.
- We will work in pairs, each one will fork this project.
- We will discuss again in 15 mins.
